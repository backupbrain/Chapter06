Bluetooth Low Energy with Android and Arduino
========================================================
Chapter 5: Shaking Hands
---------------------------------------------

These are **complete downloadable code examples** from my book, _Bluetooth Low Energy with Android and Arduino_ (<url>).  The book teaches how to make Bluetooth Low Energy devices talk using Arduino in Java and Android in C++.

This chapter teaches:
* Arduino: Create a GATT Profile - a Service and Characteristic configuration
* Android: List the GATT Profile (Services and Characteristics) of a Peripheral
